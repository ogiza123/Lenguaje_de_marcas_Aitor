                            Back in 2007, a 22-year-old Mark Zuckerberg gave some advice at Y Combinator's Startup School: 
                            Do a startup before you're old. In technology, he said, twentysomethings rule.
                             The olds are useless. "I want to stress the importance of being young and technical," he said.
                              "Young people are just smarter." That comment has not aged well. As we watch tsunamis of disinfo rage 
                              through social networks, we're now suspecting it wasn't so great for cocky young techies to so rapidly 
                              reupholster the public sphere. Those dudes may have been technically adept, but they were, as one early Twitter
                              employee told me, "naive as fuck."" With little experience of the real world, the dewy pioneers were woefully u
                              nprepared for the hate speech, dog-piling, and sock-puppeted algorithm-juking that ran riot in the 2010s. 
                              Now we're living in the wreckage.
